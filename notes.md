# Social Robotic Process Automation - A Future Outlook


# Agent DevOps

Recently, the concept of *Developer Operations* (DevOps) has evolved into a widely employed *best practice* for engineering and maintaining complex information systems.
However, no approach seems to exist in academia and industry on how to integrate the agent-oriented programming paradigm with DevOps.
In this paper we present an architecture that allows for the flexible deployment of agents across devices and platforms, as well as for the business-user friendly management of agent instances.
We provide an open source framework for this DevOps-oriented agent development and management approach, which we show case with a proof-of-concept running example.
