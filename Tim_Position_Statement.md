# The Notion of an *Agent* as a Practical Software Engineering Abstraction (Position Statement)

In today's interconnected information technology ecosystems, software engineering abstractions that
are designed to encapsulate *autonomous* behavior are of increasing relevance. In the academic
Artificial Intelligence community, the notion of an *agent* is the most prominent concept in this
regard, and an active sub-community works on agent-oriented software engineering abstractions, in
particular on *Agent-Oriented Programming* (AOP) languages and frameworks.
While existing AOP variants excel at facilitating scientific exploration at the intersection of
academic programming and knowledge representation & reasoning, making the case for
agent-orientation in practical software engineering is an open problem. To address this problem,
*minimally viable* agent-oriented abstractions need to be designed in the context of mainstream
programming languages and frameworks. These abstractions should:

1. Provide a clear and intuitive value proposition to a (perhaps somewhat intellectually curious)
   practicing software engineer -- even one without a Computer Science degree;

2. Not add any non-essential overhead that steepens the learning curve and hampers adoption;

3. Come with clear design principles with regard to agent internals (reasoning cycle) and agent
   interface design (interaction and discoverability);

4. Allow for a seamless integration into continuous integration and DevOps practices, both
conceptually and from a tooling perspective.

Potential learnings can be drawn from the relatively recent spread of functional programming
flavors to mainstream and originally predominantly object-oriented programming languages and
frameworks, a high-profile example being React.js in the context of JavaScript
(for better or for worse).
