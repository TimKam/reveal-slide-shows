# Introduction - Tim
After watching Andreas' introduction video, I thought creating a video is perhaps a bit too much,
given my juniority, but writing an introduction statement could be useful. I'm Tim, a PhD Student at
Ume√• University Sweden, with a Product Management/Innovation Research side-gig for a business
process and business decision management software vendor. My primary research interests are
automated (non-monotonic) reasoning and engineering multi-agent systems. In the context of this
seminar, I am particularly interested in software engineering abstractions for implementing
cognitive agents (see [here](https://github.com/TimKam/JS-son)), and in contributing to moving 
agent-oriented programming closer to the software engineering mainstream
(see my position statement). On the theoretical side, I am interested in principle-based automated
reasoning. In particular, I research how non-monotonic reasoning approaches like formal
argumentation can be aligned with models of 'rational' micro-economic decision-making
(see [here](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/advance-article/doi/10.1093/logcom/exab003/6128412)).
However, I am not sure how relevant the theoretically-oriented part of my research interests is to
this seminar.
